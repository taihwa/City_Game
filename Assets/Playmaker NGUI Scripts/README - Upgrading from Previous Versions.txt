If you are upgrading from a previous version of "Playmaker NGUI Scripts", you should delete the folder "Playmaker NGUI Scripts" and re-import the package.

There are many breaking changes caused by NGUI v3. These issues have been addressed in this update, but prefabs and other files were changed to accomodate NGUI v3.

If you do not delete the original "Playmaker NGUI Scripts" folder, you will have errors when you do the upgrade.
